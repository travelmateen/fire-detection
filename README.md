# Fire Detection using YOLOv8

[Fire Detection]

This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv8 trained to detect fire. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is a real-time object detection system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/salim4n/Fire_Detection.git`.

2. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

3. **Run the Code**: Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the cloned repository, and run the command `python main.py` to start the fire detection application.

## Demo

Check out this demo video to see the fire detection in action:

## Usage

- The `main.py` script processes a video stream in real-time, detecting fire using the trained YOLOv8 model.
- Use the webcam or provide a video file as input for detection.
- Detected fires are highlighted in the video with bounding boxes.
- Feel free to experiment with different video sources and scenarios.
